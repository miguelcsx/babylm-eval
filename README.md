# BabyLM Evaluation 2026
![BabyLM Challenge](strict/assets/babylm.png)

This repository contains the setup for evaluation for BabyLM 2026. We provide separate evaluation for the Strict (+Strict-Small) track, and the Multilingual track. See the two track directories for more specific information on evaluation for these two tracks.

The Multilingual Chinese zero-shot suite includes the Hanzi structure and
pinyin minimal-pair evaluations.

If you have questions about or suggestions for this code, please open an issue and consider [joining our Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/babylmchallenge/shared_invite/zt-2gqgqaumu-5ebxxADuT561aT_ooKbT1Q). Join the `#evaluation` channel, which is dedicated to support for use of this repository.

We also welcome pull requests!

### Submitting to the leaderboard

The two tracks use different submission formats:

#### Strict and Strict-small tracks

Upload a **predictions file** produced by the BabyLM evaluation pipeline. After running both zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluation on your final model, create the submission file with:

```bash
cd strict
bash scripts/collate_preds.sh NAME_OF_YOUR_MODEL BACKEND SUBMISSION_TRACK
```

Scores are computed server-side against the held-out targets, so you only upload predictions. Add the `--fast` flag to also include checkpoint evaluation results, which is required for a full BabyLM Challenge submission.

#### Multilingual track

Upload the **scores and predictions files** produced by the collator. Public
tasks use their pre-computed scores; hidden Hanzi and MECO scores are computed
server-side from raw predictions/surprisals:

```bash
cd multilingual
bash scripts/zeroshot_model.sh --model_name YOUR_MODEL --langs "eng nld zho"
bash scripts/finetune_model.sh --model_name YOUR_MODEL --langs "eng nld zho"

# Produce <model>_submission.json and <model>_predictions.json
python scripts/collate_results.py --model_name YOUR_MODEL
```

> [!NOTE]
> Incomplete evaluation is allowed for both tracks: you can submit results covering only the languages or tasks your model was trained on. Missing tasks are set to 0 and are taken into account when computing the average score.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure your model is **publicly available** on HuggingFace before submitting.

## Baselines
We train GPT-2 baseline models on the datasets. We provide monolingual models, as well as bi- and trilingual models, trained on equal language splits. The models are available on HuggingFace [here](https://huggingface.co/BabyLM-community/models).

Following [BabyBabelLM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.10159), we divide evaluation for the multilingual models up in zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluation. Zero-shot evaluation for the multilingual track is done through `lm-eval`. Fine-tuning is adapted from a script of previous BabyLM editions.
